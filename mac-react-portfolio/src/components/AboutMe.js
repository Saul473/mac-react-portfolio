                Thank you for visiting my portfolio, my name is Saul Navarro. I am 23 years old, I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. <br/>
                I graduated from Taylorsville High School and started my Computer Science degree last year. I have worked in finance for 5 years and recently started working in IT.
                During my free time I enjoy to hangout with my family and play a variety of party games of all sorts from board games to video games. I have a couple of goals in 
                my life, one is to own a Toyota Supra and the other is to get into Elite Smash with Ganondorf. Oh and to keep expanding my knowledge in code and computer science to 
                grown in my career path! <br/>
                Once again, thanks for taking the time to view my portfolio!
            </p>
